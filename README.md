RecipeApp - Food Recipe Application
Welcome to the RecipeApp GitHub repository! This application is a simple food recipe app built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. It retrieves food recipe information from a web source and displays it in various view types. The application follows best practices, with a clear separation of concerns between the View, ViewModel, and Repository layers.

Features
Retrieve and display a list of food recipes from a remote source.
Display detailed information about individual recipes.
User-friendly interface with different view types for recipes.
MVVM architecture for maintainable and scalable code.
A Repository pattern to abstract data retrieval logic.
Retrofit-based client for remote API calls.
Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main components:

View: Contains UI-related code, such as Activities and Fragments, and handles user interaction.
ViewModel: Acts as the intermediary between the View and the data layer. It maintains the state and provides data to the View.
Repository: Abstracts the data retrieval logic and communicates with the data sources.
Client: Contains the network-related code to communicate with the remote API (using Retrofit).
